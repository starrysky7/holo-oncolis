                Our studies have evaluated the anticancer properties<br>
                of natural compounds derived from plants, both in<br>
                vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical stages, some promising<br>
                compounds could be mentioned, such as the<br>
                sulforaphane or different phenolic compounds.<br>
                On the other hand, some phytochemicals obtained<br>
                positive results in clinical stages and were further<br>
                approved for cancer treatment. What makes this effort<br>
                significant is overcoming low solubility and restricted<br>
                effects while still maintaining zero side effects.
